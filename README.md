# Literary Criticism Association Quiz

A quiz app for schools of literary criticism, built with React, Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## Functionality

Questions are multiple choice, with weighted answers that correspond to different schools of literary criticism. At the end of the quiz, users receive a breakdown of their results, showing which schools they align with most closely.

Quiz data is stored in JSON format (or, in this singular limited case, a TS file exporting an object). The app is designed to be easily extendable, allowing for the addition of more questions or schools of criticism in the future.

A new version is in the works, which will allow users to create and share their own quizzes on various topics.
